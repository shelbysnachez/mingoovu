We saw it today, 100t looked amazing. Mostly every night, there are at least 3 100T players in the pro 10’s. The hunger to get better individually is better, and it’s paying up. “Practicing without a team doesn’t improve you” is just wrong. It definitely helps individual skill and from the looks of it, some optic players need personal improvement. You can’t expect to win if you can’t shoot at the same skill level as your opponent.

Hi guys, this post is just my personal opinion and it's definitely very subjective. If you don't agree with what I think then of course it's all good :) Basically for the last 1 week, I know that I want an iPad but I just have no idea which one I will like the most/the one that I consider to be the most useful. # iPad Pro 11" 2018 So to start things off, I bought an iPad Pro 11" directly from Apple Store and the Apple Pencil 2nd Gen .

With the new iPad Air 10.5 release, there's now a lot of people comparing it to the 2017 iPad Pro 10.5, especially due to price drops for both new and refurbished Pro 10.5 models. Each have pros and cons, but to me, the pros lie with the 10.5 iPad Pro due to the following: \- ProMotion \- Quad Speakers \- 4GB RAM amp#x200B; The only pros I see for the Air are: \- A12 CPU \- Neural Engine \- Coprocessor \- Newer hardware in general (different mainboard?) amp#x200B; However Интернет-магазин под ключ с неограниченным количеством товаров.

A new 10-color LUCIA pigment ink system features three black inks for amazing monochrome prints, and a Chroma Optimizer to ensure the inks lay smooth on the paper which reduces metamerism and bronzing. I was looking for a replacement for my iPad mini 4, which I use for flying. First thought: Mini 5. Not a bad choice. But how about the Air? Not that much more expensive, more screen real estate and could serve as my personal device when traveling instead of my own laptop. Then I found out that the Pro 10.5 is similar, but with a better screen. Out of curiosity I looked at refurbs first. Apple didn't have any with the cellular connection. Amazon had only ones from third party vendors. Im about to start recording my bands album, we decided we'll record dry/wet tracks of everything and stems from superior drummer 2, send those off to our producer for re amping and mixing. my question is, Im itching for an upgrade before we start the process, I've been on elements 7 for years and find the new version listing some nice features that I wouldn't mind for workflow purposes. I am worried by the reports of crashes and issues though and wonder if they have been sorted Was looking for an ipad to use for college and to use as a "main" tablet perhaps for gaming, social media, streaming netflix ect. Would you guys recommend getting an ipad pro 10.5 or is the bright spot a huge issue and its rather worth getting a 9.7 6th gen? I dont really mind if the bright spot is not too bad and if the ipad is still fully functional. 
I have an iPad pro 9.7 and I mostly use it for drawing and occassionally writing notes for my DnD campaign. Since the new update air is coming out, the pro 10.5 is on sale at Best Buy. Plus I have some reward points to spend from them. Is it worth it to upgrade and trade in my iPad for that one? I'm pretty content with mine but I don't mind having a larger screen size to write/draw. Hello community, I’m looking to purchase well maintained iPad Pro 10.5 64gb WiFi. Preferably kept in a case/screen protector. No major dents or scratches. No cracks in screen. Fully reset and free from activation lock/iCloud lock. Hopefully, without that white spot issue. Willing to do a local buy, if you’re able to meet at an Apple store in Manhattan. I had an issue with a seller just recently about meeting up at one, don’t know why. I just want to check the device and at an Apple store. So does it even make sense to get the Air when I can get the Pro for basically the same price? Like with the old pro i get: - Better screen (or at least refresh rate) - Better speakers - Better Cameras. Yes on the Air you get a more powerful processor, but really how needed is it? The one in the pro seems more than enough for 99% of the people.

To start it off, I've recently bought a new 10.5" iPad Pro from Apple(can't get refurbished ones here), less than two weeks ago to be exact. As everyone knows, Apple just announced their new 10.5" iPad Air which is cheaper than what I paid for and I'm feeling that I may have made a mistake buying the 2nd gen iPad Pro at full price. Apple is offering me a full refund and I'm wondering if I should take it and go for other newer models or keep my current iPad instead. Any thoughts.

Hello. Recently, I have been thinking about getting an iPad. I am deciding between getting the older iPad Pro 10.5 or the new iPad Air. The iPad Pro has the 120hz display, better camera, and quad speakers, while the newer model ditches those features for an Apple A12 rather than the Apple A10x. Both are the same price currently, and I can't make up my mind. Can anyone recommend me a model? Thank.
